Add new data-sets
--------------

We're always on the look-out for new, interesting, high-quality data sets to
add. If you have some data you'd like to see made available, we'd love
to hear from you. 

Here's what to do:

* Create a spreadsheet in [the Open Economy format](spreadsheet.html) with the data you want to contribute. 
  * Make sure you include accurate and up to date sources so that we can verify your data.
  * Make sure you have the rights to make the data available.

* Upload the spreadsheet to your user storage and make sure it all
  works the way you expect. At this point only you will be able to
  access it.

* [Send us an email](mailto:openeconomy@dja.id.au) with:
  * Your user name.
  * The name of your spreadsheet.
  * Confirmation that you're OK with us evaluating it and possibly
 making it public.

* We will then evaluate your spreadsheet, and may at our discretion
  make it public. 

 * If we make your spreadsheet public, you will lose the ability to
  modify or delete it. If you want to update it, upload a new version
  and send us an email.
